# clang-html

A visualizer for LLVM's linting tool: clang-tidy.

## Getting Started with pip
```
python -m pip install clang-html
python -m clang_html [logfile.log]
```

### Libraries
- [argparse](https://pypi.org/project/argparse/)
- [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)

### Prerequisites

Install [Clang-Tidy](http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) to use for your C/C++ source files.

On your local Linux machine, installation is as easy as:

```
sudo apt install clang-tidy
```

You will need bash or some other terminal to execute the script. Download Python 3 or higher [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

When running clang-tidy on your files, be sure to pipe it into a new log file of checks:

```
clang-tidy -checks=* [filename.c] | tee [newfile.log]
```

If you are receiving the following error:

> Error while trying to load a compilation database:
> Could not auto-detect compilation database for file "your_file.c"
> No compilation database found in /your/directory or any parent directory

Create a simple json file to be compiled into your project documented [here](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html).

## Running the script locally

Clone or fork this repository to run the script on your native system.

The script takes in one file argument of a txt or log file with your outputted clang-tidy checks.

```
cd src/
python -m clang_html [newfile.log]
```

Inside the same directory as clang_visualizer.py, you will find a new html file called 'clang.html'.

An example html output can be found [here](https://austinbhale.com/Clang-Visualizer/examples/clang.html).

A separate example with the external link option as a button can be found [here](https://austinbhale.com/Clang-Visualizer/examples/clang_with_button.html).

The highlighting functionality uses your local session storage, which will save your changes on exit.

Earlier versions should have support for the vast majority of checks.
